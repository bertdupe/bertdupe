- 👋 Hi, I’m Dr. Bertrand Dupé from the Nanomat group at the University of Liège in Belgium

- 👀 I’m interested in computational methods du study Condensed Matter physics. Condensed Matter Physics aims at describing the collective properties of atoms when the form a crystallin solid. 
Although it might sound complicated, it is actually rather simple: The properties (like the magnetization, the displacement...) are described in a lattice (a grid) which can have different symmetries.
To take into account for the different symmetry, we actually adapt the table of neighbors... The rest is about making sum and products.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new computational methods. Our simulations are rather straight forward in terms of mathematics but require a lot of data which can make them computationaly expensive and very slow.
